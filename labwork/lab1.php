        <p>Hello! My name is Codie Brodeur and I'm majoring in Graphic Design. I'm intested in knowing as much about the digital design space as possible. MY hobbies are learning skills that can further my career; like photography, web development and leardership skills.I'm so excited to learn PHP I really wanted to take it last semester but its only availible in the fall, so I've been excited about this class for a while. I even started learning the basics on Solo Learn.
