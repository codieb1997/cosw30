        <h1>Codie Brodeur</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Codie Brodeur and I'm majoring in Graphic Design. 
            I'm interested in knowing as much about the digital design space as possible.
            My hobbies are learning skills that can further my career; like photography, 
            web development and leadership skills. I'm so excited to learn PHP, I really 
            wanted to take it last semester but it's only availible in the fall, so I've 
            been excited for awhile. I even started learning the basics on Solo Learn.
        </p>
